Boa Constrictors are intelligent, charming, colorful, and intuitive. They are highly observant and have a knack for anticipating the behavior of others. They are very analytical by nature and while they can be eccentric at times, they calculate their moves carefully before making them. They are very good with words and can convince others to do what they want, but they also try to avoid being manipulative, unless they need to for the greater good.

Often, members of this sign spend a great deal of energy fighting an inner struggle to balance selfishness with selflessness. Part of them wants to save the world, but the practical side also wants to make sure they and their family are taken care of. Because they never act until they are ready, a Boa Constrictor can spend a great deal of time poring over decisions, which can be unhealthy because they get stressed out easily.
