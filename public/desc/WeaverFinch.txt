Patient, resourceful, and sympathetic, those born under the sign of the Weaver Finch work hard to get ahead. Lucky in money, members of this sign often pride themselves on having nice homes, furniture, and accessories. Sensitive to their surroundings, they need more than just security - they need to express a style all their own. They know they have to earn what they get, and rarely (if ever) rely on luck or the generosity of others to get by.

Like their animal namesakes, members of the Weaver Finch sign are well known for being specialists. Just as the industrious bird builds incredibly intricate nests to retire in, those born under the sign of the Weaver Finch use their organization, patience, and ingenuity to build an amazing life out of what would otherwise appear to be scraps. While the Chinese Zodiac sign of the Rabbit has trouble finishing projects, the Tropical Zodiac sign of Capricorn steps in and takes control when things need to get done.

The “law of attraction” is particularly strong for Weaver Finches in that they are particularly gifted in attracting the things they think about the most. The tricky part is that they are often focused on all the wrong things! The love of money, power, status, beauty, and emotional experience can overpower the very best of intentions for this sign. Likewise, they must be particularly careful to keep a positive, optimistic attitude through hardships as their own attitude will be the biggest factor in how long obstacles take to conquer.
