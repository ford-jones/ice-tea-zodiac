People tend to assume that Sloths are lazy, but this is really not the case. Sure, they prefer to hang around their home a good deal, but it’s not because they don’t want to do anything, they just like to take things slow. Like their animal namesake, members of the Sloth sign are unafraid to show their unique nature. They are extremely friendly to the point of seeming a bit naive. That paired with their tendency to avoid confrontation and it’s easy to see why others often see Sloths as being weak.

In reality, Sloths are great diplomats. They are socially adept when they want to be, and approach even the most difficult situations with patience and grace. While they are exceptional keeping cool under pressure, they tend to internalize the negative emotions of those around them, though you would never know it by looking at them. When this happens, Sloths shut down and keep to themselves, which is difficult for them and those who know them well. They prefer helping others with their problems over sharing their own, which only makes it harder for their friends and family to help them when they get depressed.
