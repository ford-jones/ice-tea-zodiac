Like their animal namesake, those born under the sign of the Ant are tireless workers. They can handle the kind of workload that would crush other people, but this can take its toll on other areas of their lives. Ants don’t have a lot of hobbies. They prefer mastering one or two skills and stick to those unless they think they can get further ahead a different way. Ants are extremely ambitious and though they may seem almost boring on the outside they are internally driven toward greatness.

One of the greatest life challenges for this sign is learning to balance their work with the rest of their lives. Far too often Ants push aside all personal joy in order to get as close to perfection as possible. Relationships work for them because they love to help others achieve their goals by creating plans and offering other assistance, but too often this only comes between long stretches of self-focused work.

Ants expect a lot from themselves, and they also expect a lot from others. They have little tolerance for those who they don’t think are giving their all. In truth Ants can be judgmental to the point of being conceited. They want and expect the best from everyone and often find themselves disappointed that others don’t or can’t live up to their standards.
