Much like their animal namesake, members of the Bird-of-Paradise Primal Zodiac sign are colorful, adventurous, and naturally draw attention from those around them. They want to make the most out of life, so they make big goals and big plans and truly believe in their ability to achieve them. In truth, they have more ability to achieve big goals than many other Primal Zodiac signs, as long as they can stay humble enough to see their lives for what they really are, not what they want them to be.

With such big dreams, a Bird-of-Paradise can easily get lost on the wrong path. They will chase a dream to the ends of the Earth, but if theyâ€™ve lost perspective, it may be the opposite end of the Earth they intended to be on. They succeed mostly because of their confidence and likability. Their big personalities and ability to get things done draw people in and make them believe in whatever the Bird-of-Paradise wants them to. They are not manipulators, though. They believe that honesty is the best policy, even if that honesty is offensive to others.
