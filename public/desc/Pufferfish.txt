The Pufferfish is largely misunderstood. That goes for the animal as well as the Primal Zodiac sign. Often seen as dangerous and unpredictable, Pufferfish really just want to be left alone by people (or fish) that they don’t know. That’s not to say that members of this sign are not social. In fact, they strongly prefer being with friends and family over being alone. It’s just that they like things they way they expect them to be, and new people or places disrupt that aspect of their personality.

Members of this sign are intelligent, insightful, kind, helpful, and well-liked. They can easily be taken advantage of though, and they tend to go along with any plan as long as they believe they are doing good. The only time they become truly dangerous, though, is when they realize they have been pushed too far. As with their animal namesake, those who try to take advantage of a Pufferfish will end up taking in much more pain than they anticipated.

The mind of a Pufferfish is always full of ideas. Many members of this sign are honest to goodness geniuses, which can be both a blessing and a curse. With the proper outlet, they can make brilliant strides in art, music, science, medicine, engineering, or whatever they put their overactive minds into. Without some practicality around them to even them out, however, Pufferfish can become the figurative ‘mad scientist’ of the Primal Zodiac, obsessing over esoteric projects of their own design.
