Those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Parrot like to be straight to the point. Some may say they are blunt to a fault. Like their animal namesake, members of this sign often speak without realizing what they are saying. This can lead to some funny moments as well as some offensive ones. Parrots don’t intend to be rude, they are just very observant, honest, and straightforward, so they end up saying whatever is on their mind without considering the repercussions. Some learn to embrace this nature and incorporate their cutting observances into their sense of humor (such as famous Parrot and comedian Joan Rivers), while others eventually learn to keep their strong opinions to themselves (as best they can).

This is a highly independent sign that listens to their instincts rather than following the status quo. Luckily they are naturally street-smart and their instincts are usually right on target. Parrots like to dress nicely and though they pretend they don’t, they actually do care how others perceive them. Members of this sign tend to be constantly on the move and are always trying to accomplish something with their time. This can make them appear distracted and disorganized, but they are actually quite focused in their own way. Parrots long for the good life and love to dream about the fabulous lifestyle they will someday live.
