Of all of the Primal Zodiac signs, Handfish are most likely to be considered “strange”. Like their animal namesake, members of this sign like to do things their own way, which often baffles others. Any of the Primal Zodiac signs that fall under the sun sign of Aquarius are a bit eccentric, but this sign in particular is the least understood. This is mostly because Handfish are the least likely to explain themselves. Though they are actually very friendly, they tend to be quiet and reserved, and feel perfectly comfortable living in their own wild fantasies. Though they seem shy, members of the Handfish sign actually prefer being in a group situation; they are simply content to let others have the spotlight while they observe, ready to contribute to the group when asked.

Not surprisingly, Handfish are extremely creative thinkers. They have enormous imaginations and are always coming up with new ideas. You’ll often find a Handfish staring out the window or off into the distance. In these times they are lost deep in their own thoughts, and often live more of their life in their mind than outside of it. This can be a challenge for them in social, career, and education environments. They are usually very smart and get through school despite not ever paying attention to their instructor. They do best in careers where their minds are challenged, and where they can have time to think before they act.


While usually quite serene, Handfish can be prone to anxiety. When this happens, it tends to spiral their worlds out of control. Strong anxiety left unchecked can be mentally toxic to a Handfish, and thus they should be careful not to lose touch with reality, which they have a natural tendency to do.
