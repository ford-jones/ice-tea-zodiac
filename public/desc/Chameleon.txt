Chameleons, like their namesake animal, are nearly impossible to perceive correctly. That’s because Chameleons never stay the same for long. From an outside perspective, the chameleon can at any time appear confidently eccentric or anxiously insane. Chameleons love to explore and are only truly held down to Earth by their own internal practicality, that shows up every once in awhile when they really need it. One thing that nobody can question about Chameleons, though, is their kind and giving nature. Though they often seem to be in pursuit of whatever shiny object catches their attention at the moment, members of this sign are always looking out for their fellow man. It would be just like a Chameleon to disappear for an annoyingly long amount of time just to show up suddenly with the perfect gift that they spent hours at an antique store looking for - just for you.

Chameleons spend a lot of time in their own head. While they are often social, political, and outspoken, they also have an alter-ego that is practical, frugal, and down to Earth. Don’t bother trying to figure out this contradiction, it’s just the way they are. At best, the Chameleon is an exciting, passionate, and has a unique voice that aims to change the world for the better. At worst, members of this sign are anxious, uncertain, suspicious, and defensive. Any member of this sign will struggle with the balancing act between reality and the ideal world they believe that they can make real.
