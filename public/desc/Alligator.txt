Those born under the sign of the Alligator are significantly different from their fellow Capricorns in their approach to achieving success (a Capricorn hallmark). Rather than climb, climb, climb to the top at a slow and steady pace, Alligators believe in working smarter, not harder.

Like their animal namesake, members of this sign prefer to wait patiently for opportunity to come to them. Just as the deadly swamp beast sits in motionless silence waiting for prey to mistake the calm waters around them for safety, those born under this sign exemplify a patience, cunning, and tenacity that few others can match. Their success comes not from trudging forward, but from staying perfectly, even unnaturally still, using their instincts to know exactly when to strike. While others may interpret this approach as lazy or lucky (since Alligators usually end up getting what they want), it works for members of this sign who embrace this aspect of their personality.


Alligators have very specific tastes and like to get exactly what they want. This often leads to some of this sign’s least attractive behaviors. Members of this sign can be downright snobbish and conceited when they don’t approve of other people’s tastes. They are not trying to be rude, Alligators simply don’t realize that they don’t hide their true feelings as well as they think they do. They can also come across as overly aloof, indifferent, and elusive in social situations.

The most important life lesson for an Alligator is to find a balance between all the different sides of life. Having a tendency to get overly focused on one thought or belief, members of this sign need to learn to combine their intelligence and drive with their instincts and passions in order to get the most out of life. There is also a tendency among Alligators to overly value shows of wealth and success by others. Trying to impress others with success and wealth of their own is likely to lead to imbalance.
