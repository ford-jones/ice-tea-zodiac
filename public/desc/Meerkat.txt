Meerkat is a highly contradictory sign. Members of this sign struggle with different parts of their personality on a regular basis, though those around them will hardly notice. They are simultaneously philanthropic and greedy. They want to be seen as different from everyone else while being accepted by those same people. They are talkative, charming, and funny one day and quietly lost in their own thoughts the next. They are often extremely friendly and likable but can be self-centered and downright aggressive at any time.

Members of the Meerkat sign are always deeply intelligent and perceptive. They can see what everyone else sees, but on deeper levels and multiple layers with ease. It’s unlikely that anyone will be able to get anything past a Meerkat without them noticing, though it’s equally unlikely that they will let you know if they are onto your game. They are capable of accomplishing just about anything they want to, but they often struggle with knowing exactly what that is.
