Dependable, ambitious, and independent, those born under the sign of the Mole are also some of the most likely to care about how others perceive them. Of course, they will deny this, but one look at their purposefully constructed appearance will tell you otherwise. Often fitting in by “not fitting in”, members of this sign are often mired in unnecessary self-doubt.

Like their animal namesake, Moles don’t make a lot of sudden moves. Instead they cautiously calculate their strategies in life in order to avoid making unnecessary mistakes. They are strong and determined individuals who do their best work when focused on a goal. Like the animal they are far stronger than others realize and can be masterful architects of their own unique little world that few others ever even know exists.

What Moles struggle with most is an obsession with prudence. They want to make the right choice all of the time, but as is the case with life they don’t always know ahead of time what the right choice will be. If they don’t make a decision in a reasonable amount of time the choice will linger and fester like a wound, growing ever more difficult to deal with the more time passes. Luckily, with Capricorn representing the solar aspect of this sign, raw ambition will often save the day when logic and planning fail.

Several members of this sign will show signs of advanced intelligence from a young age, and this may cause them to accept the role of “intellectual” for longer than it suits them. It is the Chinese Zodiac sign of the Sheep that brings both intelligence and artistic qualities, and both can be extremely useful when approaching the kinds of challenges that Moles like to take on.
